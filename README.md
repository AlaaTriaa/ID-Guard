As part of the P2M project, Id-Guard is designed is an application designed by Higher
School of Communications students Alaeddine TRIAA and Nassim DRIDI  to help security services and security managers significantly increase their
efficiency, timely respond to incidents at the facility, and quickly conduct investigations,
excluding hours of long-term viewing of the video archive.

# Development :

![1 Our GUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87854467/139739973-64513ab3-f6ad-49d3-b54c-1ad7e8712d3a.PNG)

This User Interface is the application that can be manipulated by the security team. It contains
multiple features depending on the pressed button.

![2 User Management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87854467/139740404-a931f619-0626-4763-afd4-d7145899eddf.PNG)

In this part, an Administrator can add a new access permission to a new Person by entering the
details of the latter. Then by pressing Generate dataset, the application will take multiple pictures
in a small period of time of this Person followed by a small training session.
After the training is complete, the user will be added to the database with all the details given to
the security application.

![3 Verify Identity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87854467/139740408-13e38b72-2f7e-4203-ab19-93733b312b6a.PNG)

This is the Main feature of the application. Once the button is clicked, a screen will appear which
will give a live feed to the security team and every time a face is detected, it will show some of
the main details of that Person. In case that person is not in the database, it will be the case of a
trespassing. The application will show UNKNOWN next to the unrecognized person and a
warning sound will be released while showing “Stranger” on the UI.

![4 User’s Info ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87854467/139740424-7fb5d726-2d75-44b5-abc2-63d86d600b6a.PNG)

By pressing User’s Info, the Camera will detect the face and search the database to find a match.
Once it’s found, the details will appear on the side window with a Real-Time Picture of that
person

![5 Alarm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87854467/139740435-fd48fefc-30c1-4897-aeb6-4752e1218d29.PNG)
